# arc

`arc` is a simple arc tool data transformer.

The `arc` CLI tool allows GIS and Data Analysts to extract data generated by a custom ESRI [ArcGIS tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/an-overview-of-the-analysis-toolbox.htm) (Arc Tool) and save data in the CSV format. Next, GIS analysts import generated file to a spreadsheet.

The main requirements/assumptions are that input files are not larger than 10 MB; the analysts run the tool manually and manually import the CSV output file into spreadsheets.

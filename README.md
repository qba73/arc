# arct

A simple arc tool data transformer

The arct command-line utility was developed to solve a business problem related to log data processing.

The tool allows GIS and Data Analysts to extract specific data generated by a custom ESRI ArcGIS plugin (Arc Tool) and save the data in a CSV format. In the following step, analysts import the generated file to an EXCEL spreadsheet for further analysis.

The main requirements/assumptions are that input files are not larger than 10 MB; the analysts run the tool manually and manually import the CSV output file into spreadsheets.
